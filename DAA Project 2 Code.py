Problem Statement: Convex hull
We are given a set P of n points in a two-dimensional plan, and we want to compute the convex hull of P. 
The convex hull is defined as the smallest convex polygon containing the points. (A way to visualize a 
convex hull is to imagine nails on all the points of the plane and put an elastic band around the points 
â€“ the shape of the elastic band is the convex hull.) 

Describe an O(n log n) time divide and conquer algorithm to find the convex hull of the set P of n points.
