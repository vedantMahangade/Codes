;The provided clojure program can be excuted using https://replit.com/
;steps to execute the code:
;1. It would be required to create an account first to use the online IDE
;2. When the 'Start building with a template' appears please click in Browse templates at the bottom right of the dialog box
;3. Search and select closure and then provide a title to the workspace adn then click on create repl
;4. Once the environment is setup copy and paste the program and click on the Run button on the top-middle of the screen.Â 
;5. The out should appear on the left side console
;
;The below clojure program uses a main function as adriver code
;It fisrt extracts the stopwords from a URL and then extracts and preprosses the words from the book URL
; once the preprocessing is completed the tokenize-and-count function removes the stopwords and assigns frequency for each word followed by sorting the words based on frequency and finaly returns the top ten
;the top ten words allong with their count are then printed
;
